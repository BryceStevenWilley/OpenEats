# Bugs to file:

* Without a picture, recipes can't be added to calendar/printed (buttons don't show up)
* Have to continually submit recipes to get the pictures to stay (if saved, pictures go away)
* ingredients have clarifications when added to grocery lists
* be able to parse and combine sizes of ingredients when added to lists
  * once parsed into amnt and ingredient, sort by ingredient name
* All menu ingredients to grocery list with a button

# Features

* Markdown for the ingredients / directions / nested hierarchies.
* bring up all tags when adding tags: can't see what's been previously added
